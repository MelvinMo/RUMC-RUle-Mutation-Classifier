## Abstract
As the field of data analysis grows rapidly due to the large amounts of data being generated, effective data classification has become increasingly important. This paper introduces the **RU**le **M**utation **C**lassifier (RUMC) in this matter. RUMC uses innovative rule mutation techniques based on evolutionary methods to improve classification accuracy. In tests with forty datasets from OpenML and the UCI Machine Learning Repository, RUMC consistently outperformed twenty other well-known classifiers, demonstrating its ability to uncover valuable insights from complex data.
